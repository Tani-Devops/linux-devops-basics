# Day 1 - Linux Filesystem & Permissions 

## Filesystem 
- / : root 
- /etc : system config 
- /var : logs and variable data 
- /home : user data 
- /usr : installed programs 

## Permissions
- r = read, w = write, x = execute 
- Numeric examples: 700, 644 
- Ownership: user/group/others 

## Links 
- Hard vs soft links 

## Why it matters in DevOps 
Correct permissions prevent service failures and security risks.
